Here Clyde must stop one of his friends being killed by the demons, who are using some sort of ACME device.  This is a puzzle game stage, where you must use the items in the room to kill one of the demons threatening Clyde's friend.  Clues can also be bought from the witch.  Whatever the outcome, either death will be gory, although the cartoony graphics of the game means that things aren't really graphic.\n",

The events start when Shank's bus is halted and due to his fights against Magnus's minions the locals think he joins their rebellion.\n",
      "Combat is based around chaining attacks together, using revolvers, knives, a shotgun, a chainsaw, a baseball bat, grenades, mines, and more. Offensive attacks combine melee combat with long-ranged attacks, and always with a cartoon-like, over-the-top sense of violence and gore. The block ability from the first game has been replaced by a roll maneuve tot dodge incoming attacks. Entirely new is a counter action. When enemies attack a red exclamation mark appears above their heads. When timed correctly it is possible to grapple them, prevent the attack, and counter with an instant kill. The type of counter attack is different for each type of equipped weapon. Shooting has been made more fluent and it is now possible to switch weapons mid-air or more quickly in the middle of a combo. Weapons can no longer be traded in during levels. It is defined at the start of the game (with a number of weapons that need to be unlocked) and the gear load-out can now be changed after death. Sometimes it is possible to use or activate items in the environment to take out many opponents at once. There are also items such as turrets, decoys, and even a wild boar that can be introduced to hinder the enemy.\n",

Outsider communities tend to degenerate into \"gangs\", who rule through brute force and use their \"Battle Wheels\" combat vehicles to retain control. Most of the gangs are collections of angry, twisted individuals brought together by common goals and a common hatred of everyone else.

The Sixers, requiring constant sustenance prey on all the other inhabitants of the wasteland. When the Red Sixers attack and destroy the town of Stadium City, one inhabitant swears revenge.

Next to the classic gameplay, the player has access to a magic bar with limited supply to destroy bricks with fireballs. Other spells cause the ball movement pattern to reverse or offers the player to teleport the ball to any location on the field. Items such as coins, additional magic and lives are gathered by what the bricks leave behind. Monsters move between the bricks and can cause the ball to bounce in an unexpected direction. Buttons can be pressed to open up bonus areas or shops. Shops offer additional lives, full magic or a magnet that causes the ball to stick. While playing the ball speed is increased with each bounce. When it drops from the bottom of the screen, the gameplay is restarted and the player gets to decide the direction to launch the ball. The player starts with three lives and a limited amount of continues. When they are used up, additional continues can be bought, but they eat up a lot of money.\n",

King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.).

But was it really the end of the Overlord? Not really. He may be gone (for now) but he left something behind: his son, the Overlad. Smuggled to the icy lands of Nordberg, he managed to grow up in peace until his evil instincts surfaced and he was found by the Empire. Although he managed to escape, he fell into ice water and was doomed to freeze to death. But not to worry: Minion-master Gnarl finds his new master and after 50 years frozen solid it's finally time for vengeance upon the Glorious Empire and its leaders.\n",
      "This time setting up shop in the Netherworld, the player takes over the control of the Overlad from a 3rd-person-perspective in order to reclaim the lands. To help him with that task he has once again access to four different types of minions: browns, reds, greens and blues. While the browns are good melee-fighters, the greens are immune to poisonous gas and the blues can swim. This comes in handy for the player to overcome the many obstacles in his way like angry elves and legion soldiers or burning road-blocks which can only be removed by the reds. Again the minions increase their strength by collecting helmets and stuff from dead enemies or broken chests. The Overlad can also increase his strength by finding new spells, armor and weapons and forging the latter in return for a minion-sacrifice in his tower. New this time around is the option to resurrect fallen but valuable minions as well as the ability of the minions to ride mounts like wolves, giving them access to new skills like jumping over obstacles and such. Also new: at specific points the Overlad can take direct control of one of his minion and by doing so access areas that were unreachable before.\n",
      "The game also features a multiplayer-mode for two players over LAN, WAN and thanks to split-screen even on one machine in which they can either work together to survive wave after wave of enemies or kill a very powerful Centurion or fight each other and win by collecting enough gold or killing the other Overlord enough times.\n",
