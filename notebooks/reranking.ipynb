Looking for a way back, it roams the environments and meets the droids left behind, inhabiting the world devoid of the humans who designed them. The game mixes different types of gameplay in a largely linear experience. The cat navigates the environment by jumping on objects to find a way up or through sections. (Optional) prompts appear where it is possible to navigate and these can be strung together in a fluid, parkour-like chain.\n",
      "One type of gameplay is through linear corridors, slowly exploring and finding a route. Other sections are fast-paced, involving Zurks, creatures that form groups and try to jump the cat. They attach themselves to the protagonist and can be shaken loose, but only for a while when their number is low. It is possible to die in these sections, so quick navigation is required combined with puzzle-solving. Later on a Defluxor device becomes available with brief use to destroy them using UV light. A third type of section is more of a hub environment with a large amount of freedom. Locations can be explored in any direction, getting on rooftops, sneaking inside buildings through windows and solving puzzles along the way. These sections often have goals locating specific items or droids, but also a lot of optional quests through collectibles and locating memories that provide more information about what happened to the city. It is possible to talk to characters through the B-12 flying drone, which the cat meets early on and is carried on his back. The droid is able to offer hints, light up the surroundings with a torch, translate the environment and can communicate with other characters. There are also items that can be picked up and are stored in an inventory. Some sections incorporate stealth, sneaking past characters or quickly avoiding security droids.\n",
      "A lot of the gameplay revolves around typical cat behaviour interwoven with the game mechanics. It is possible to meow to attract the attention of enemies, push down items off objects, hide in cardboard boxes and jump on levers to activate them. The cat can also scratch doors to get the attention of those inside. Many of these interactions are also optional, such as lying down to sleep or nuzzling up legs.\n",

Outsider communities tend to degenerate into \"gangs\", who rule through brute force and use their \"Battle Wheels\" combat vehicles to retain control. Most of the gangs are collections of angry, twisted individuals brought together by common goals and a common hatred of everyone else. Feared by all are the dreaded Red Sixers, crazed cannibalistic mutants created by the negative life energy produced by the dying world. The Sixers, requiring constant sustenance prey on all the other inhabitants of the wasteland. When the Red Sixers attack and destroy the town of Stadium City, one inhabitant swears revenge. Managing to drive off the Red Sixers' leader, Rant, this young rookie's deeds gain the attention of another gang, The Company. He is recruited into their ranks and sent on a variety of missions to wage war on rival gangs.\n",
      "Redline is a combination of First Person Shooter and Vehicular Combat game. Players can fight their enemies on foot with a variety of weapons, or hop into an empty Battle Wheels rig and start blowing things up with the vehicle's built in weapons. While inside of a car, the player is able to run over enemies, but while on foot is very much vulnerable to becoming street pizza by enemy rigs. Players can exit the vehicle and continue on foot at any time.\n",
      "Gameplay takes place in huge outdoor levels which contain a variety of buildings and structures which will need to be explored on foot. The levels are in a \"modular\" format similar to Dark Forces or Aliens Versus Predator, in that instead of going from one level to the next, players are able to select any previous level from the new game menu. Unlike those games however, Redline has an ingame save feature which is good since it doesn't have an \"easy\" difficulty setting.\n",
      "There are a total of twelve missions in the single player game which will take the player to locations such as Stadium City, Templar Strongholds, Battewheels combat tournaments and even Area 51.\n",

Although he managed to defeat the final boss and claim hell itself for his vast empire, the Jester once again crossed his plans and doomed him to forever be trapped down there. But was it really the end of the Overlord? Not really. He may be gone (for now) but he left something behind: his son, the Overlad. Smuggled to the icy lands of Nordberg, he managed to grow up in peace until his evil instincts surfaced and he was found by the Empire. Although he managed to escape, he fell into ice water and was doomed to freeze to death. But not to worry: Minion-master Gnarl finds his new master and after 50 years frozen solid it's finally time for vengeance upon the Glorious Empire and its leaders.\n",
      "This time setting up shop in the Netherworld, the player takes over the control of the Overlad from a 3rd-person-perspective in order to reclaim the lands. To help him with that task he has once again access to four different types of minions: browns, reds, greens and blues. While the browns are good melee-fighters, the greens are immune to poisonous gas and the blues can swim. This comes in handy for the player to overcome the many obstacles in his way like angry elves and legion soldiers or burning road-blocks which can only be removed by the reds. Again the minions increase their strength by collecting helmets and stuff from dead enemies or broken chests. The Overlad can also increase his strength by finding new spells, armor and weapons and forging the latter in return for a minion-sacrifice in his tower. New this time around is the option to resurrect fallen but valuable minions as well as the ability of the minions to ride mounts like wolves, giving them access to new skills like jumping over obstacles and such. Also new: at specific points the Overlad can take direct control of one of his minion and by doing so access areas that were unreachable before.\n",
      "The game also features a multiplayer-mode for two players over LAN, WAN and thanks to split-screen even on one machine in which they can either work together to survive wave after wave of enemies or kill a very powerful Centurion or fight each other and win by collecting enough gold or killing the other Overlord enough times.\n",

When reaching the temple the game switches to a one to one fighting game style. The basic gameplay stays the same but if the special energy bar is filled to the max the play can use an extremely powerful attack which results in a typical anime cutscene. But it is not without downsides: the enemy can block the attack by mastering a quicktime event (pressing a button in the exact moment it appears on screen). Then he starts an equally powerful counter attack which results in a sequence where both players need to mash buttons - if the counter attack is successful depends on which player is faster.
