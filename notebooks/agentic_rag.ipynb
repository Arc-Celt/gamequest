    "2. **Tool Integration**: Connecting your existing retrieval systems\n",
    "3. **Local Model Setup**: Running everything offline\n",

    "**Regular RAG**: Query ‚Üí Retrieve ‚Üí Generate\n",
    "- Simple, linear process\n",
    "- Limited reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agentic RAG**: Query ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Retrieve ‚Üí Reason ‚Üí Generate\n",
    "- Multi-step reasoning\n",
    "- Can use multiple tools\n",
    "- Self-correcting and adaptive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- **Regular RAG**: \"Find games like Don't Starve\" ‚Üí Direct similarity search\n",
    "- **Agentic RAG**: \"I want a survival game that's challenging but not too dark\" ‚Üí \n",

    "  2. Searches for survival games\n",
    "  3. Filters by difficulty and tone\n",
